# Students.json Guideline

### This is the format of the entire JSON file.

`{ "students": [ { "name": "Roshane", "stars": 1 }, { "name": "Crystal", "stars": 10 } ] } `

##

If you'd like to add another student it will go within the array of objects called `students`, ensure that all the default parameters are in this
object or you will have errors.

Ensure that the JSON file is called `students.json` or you'll also receive errors.

The program will generate any amount of stars in the `stars` parameter however `1-10` is a great range for clean UI display.
