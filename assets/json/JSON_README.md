# Students.json Guideline

### This is the format of the entire JSON file.

`{ "students": [ { "id": 1, "name": "Roshane", "stars": 10 }, { "id": 2, "name": "Showana", "stars": 7 }] }`

##

If you'd like to add another student it will go within the array of objects called `students`, ensure that all the default parameters are in this
object or you will have errors.
